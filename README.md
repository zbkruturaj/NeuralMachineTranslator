# NeuralMachineTranslator
This repository contains the code for a NMT made from scratch without the use of any libraries other than numpy.

The CBOW.py is an implementation of continious bag of words. It uses tricks like Hirerchical softmax to train word 
embeddings pretty quickly.

The plan of the project is to implement a NMT using Convolutional Neural Networks and the word embeddings trained by CBOW.py
